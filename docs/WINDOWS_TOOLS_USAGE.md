# Using Windows Tools from Nexus-USB

## How Windows Tools Work

Nexus-USB includes Windows portable applications (like Malwarebytes, CPU-Z, etc.) that can be used in two ways:

### Method 1: Boot into Windows PE Environment (Recommended)

**What is Windows PE?**
Windows PE (Preinstallation Environment) is a minimal Windows system that boots from USB, similar to how Nexus-USB's Linux environment works.

**Using Hiren's BootCD PE (Included in Nexus-USB):**

1. Boot Nexus-USB USB drive
2. From GRUB menu, select "Hiren's BootCD PE"
3. Boots into Windows PE environment
4. Navigate to Nexus-USB partition (usually D: or E:)
5. Go to `Windows-Tools` folder
6. Run Malwarebytes or other Windows tools
7. Scan the infected Windows installation (usually C:)

**Advantages:**
- Windows tools run natively
- Full functionality
- Can scan offline Windows installations
- Malware can't interfere (Windows PE is clean)

### Method 2: Boot into Infected Windows (Less Safe)

1. Boot into your regular Windows installation
2. Insert Nexus-USB USB drive
3. Navigate to USB drive in File Explorer
4. Go to `Windows-Tools\Antivirus` folder
5. Run Malwarebytes portable
6. Scan system

**Disadvantages:**
- Malware is running and can interfere
- Some malware blocks antivirus tools
- Less effective than offline scanning

### Method 3: Use Wine in Linux (Limited)

Some Windows tools can run in Linux using Wine, but with limitations:

```bash
# Install Wine (if not already installed)
sudo apt install wine

# Run Windows tool
wine /path/to/tool.exe
```

**Note:** Not all tools work well with Wine, especially antivirus software.

## Using Malwarebytes

### Option A: From Hiren's BootCD PE (Best Method)

**Step-by-step:**

1. **Boot Nexus-USB**
   - Insert USB and restart
   - Select Nexus-USB from boot menu

2. **Select Hiren's BootCD PE**
   - From GRUB menu, choose "Hiren's BootCD PE"
   - Wait for Windows PE to load

3. **Locate Malwarebytes**
   - Open File Explorer
   - Navigate to Nexus-USB partition (D: or E:)
   - Go to `Windows-Tools\Antivirus\`
   - Find `Malwarebytes.exe` or `mbam-setup.exe`

4. **Run Malwarebytes**
   - Double-click to launch
   - If installer, install to RAM disk (X:\)
   - Update definitions (if internet available)

5. **Scan Infected System**
   - Select "Scan" or "Threat Scan"
   - Choose C: drive (infected Windows installation)
   - Wait for scan to complete (30-60 minutes)

6. **Remove Threats**
   - Review detected threats
   - Click "Quarantine" or "Remove"
   - Restart to Windows

**Why This Works:**
- Windows PE is clean and isolated
- Malware on C: drive isn't running
- Malwarebytes has full access to scan
- Malware can't defend itself or hide

### Option B: From Regular Windows (If System Still Boots)

**Step-by-step:**

1. **Boot into Windows**
   - Boot your regular Windows (if possible)

2. **Insert Nexus-USB**
   - Plug in Nexus-USB drive
   - Open in File Explorer

3. **Navigate to Malwarebytes**
   - Go to `Windows-Tools\Antivirus\`
   - Find Malwarebytes portable

4. **Run as Administrator**
   - Right-click Malwarebytes
   - Select "Run as Administrator"

5. **Update and Scan**
   - Update definitions
   - Run "Threat Scan" or "Custom Scan"
   - Remove detected threats

**Limitations:**
- Active malware may interfere
- Some rootkits can hide from scanners
- Less effective than offline scanning

### Option C: Malwarebytes Bootable (If Available)

Some versions of Malwarebytes offer bootable rescue environments:

1. Download Malwarebytes Bootable from another PC
2. Add ISO to Nexus-USB ISO collection
3. Boot from Malwarebytes ISO
4. Scan infected system

## Troubleshooting

### Malwarebytes Won't Run in Windows PE
- Check if file is corrupted
- Try different version (portable vs installer)
- Some versions require full Windows
- Use alternative: AdwCleaner, Kaspersky VRT

### Can't Find Windows-Tools Partition
- In Windows PE, check all drive letters (D:, E:, F:)
- Look for partition labeled "WINTOOLS"
- Use Disk Management to view all partitions

### Tools Require Internet
- Windows PE includes network drivers
- Connect ethernet cable or WiFi
- Some tools work offline with older definitions

### Tool Says "Not Compatible"
- Some tools require full Windows
- Try in regular Windows instead of PE
- Check tool requirements

## Adding Your Own Windows Tools

1. Download portable version of tool
2. Copy to `Windows-Tools\[Category]\` folder
3. Organize by category:
   - Antivirus
   - Recovery
   - SystemInfo
   - Utilities
   - Network

4. Rebuild Nexus-USB or copy directly to USB

## Best Practices

**For Malware Scanning:**
1. Always scan offline (Windows PE or Linux)
2. Update definitions before scanning
3. Use multiple scanners for thoroughness
4. Save scan logs for reference
5. Quarantine before deleting (in case of false positives)

**For System Recovery:**
1. Boot Windows PE for Windows tools
2. Use Linux environment for cross-platform tools
3. Always backup before making changes
4. Test tools on clean system first

**For Security:**
1. Don't boot infected Windows if avoidable
2. Use offline scanning when possible
3. Change passwords from clean system
4. Verify tools are from official sources

## Summary

**Windows tools in Nexus-USB work best when:**
- Used from Hiren's BootCD PE environment
- Scanning offline Windows installations
- Combined with Linux-based ClamAV scanning
- Updated with latest definitions

**Malwarebytes specifically:**
- Excellent for Windows malware, adware, PUPs
- Best used from Windows PE environment
- Complements ClamAV scanning
- Industry-leading detection rates

This dual-environment approach (Linux + Windows PE) gives you the best of both worlds for comprehensive system rescue and malware removal.
