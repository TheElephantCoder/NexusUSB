## Building Minimal ISO

```bash
# Install dependencies
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y debootstrap grub-pc-bin grub-efi-amd64-bin xorriso \
    squashfs-tools mtools isolinux syslinux-utils

# Build minimal ISO
sudo ./build-minimal.sh

# Output: dist/Nexus-USB-Minimal.iso (~2GB)
```

## Use Cases

### Remote Support Scenario
1. Boot client machine with Nexus-USB Minimal
2. Connect to network (WiFi or Ethernet)
3. Start xrdp or x11vnc server
4. Connect remotely from your machine
5. Perform diagnostics and repairs remotely

### Quick Malware Scan
1. Boot infected machine
2. Run ClamAV full system scan
3. Remove detected threats
4. Reboot to cleaned system

### Emergency Data Recovery
1. Boot machine with failed drive
2. Use TestDisk to recover partitions
3. Use PhotoRec to recover files
4. Copy recovered data to external drive

### Network Diagnostics
1. Boot machine with network issues
2. Use nmap to scan network
3. Test connectivity with ping/traceroute
4. Configure network with NetworkManager

## Remote Access Setup

### As RDP Server (Accept Connections)
```bash
# From Nexus-USB menu: Remote Access > Start RDP Server
# Or manually:
systemctl start xrdp
ip addr  # Note your IP address

# From another machine:
# Windows: mstsc.exe, enter IP address
# Linux: remmina, connect to IP:3389
# Mac: Microsoft Remote Desktop, enter IP
```

### As VNC Server (Accept Connections)
```bash
# From Nexus-USB menu: Remote Access > Start VNC Server
# Or manually:
x11vnc -display :0 -forever -shared

# From another machine:
# Use any VNC client (TightVNC, RealVNC, etc.)
# Connect to IP:5900
```

### As RDP/VNC Client (Connect to Others)
```bash
# From Nexus-USB menu: Remote Access > Remmina
# Or manually:
remmina

# In Remmina:
# 1. Click "New connection profile"
# 2. Select protocol (RDP or VNC)
# 3. Enter server address
# 4. Enter credentials
# 5. Connect
```

### SSH Access
```bash
# Start SSH server:
systemctl start ssh
passwd  # Set root password

# From another machine:
ssh root@[nexus-usb-ip]
```

## Advantages of Minimal ISO

1. **Fast Download** - Only 2GB vs 10GB+ for full build
2. **Quick Boot** - Minimal system boots faster
3. **Low RAM** - Runs on machines with 2GB RAM
4. **Easy to Update** - Smaller size means faster rebuilds
5. **Focused Tools** - Only essential tools, less clutter
6. **USB Friendly** - Fits on smaller USB drives (4GB+)

## When to Use Full Build Instead

Use the full build (./build.sh) when you need:
- Multiple antivirus scanners
- Penetration testing tools
- Windows portable applications
- Bootable ISO collection
- Forensics tools
- Complete toolkit for professional use

## Customizing Minimal Build

Edit `scripts/install-minimal-tools.sh` to add/remove tools:

```bash
# Add a tool
chroot "$WORK_DIR" apt install -y your-package-name

# Remove a tool
# Just comment out or delete the line
```

Keep the ISO under 2GB by:
- Using `--no-install-recommends` flag
- Avoiding large packages
- Cleaning apt cache after installation
- Removing unnecessary documentation

## Network Configuration

### WiFi Setup
```bash
# From menu: Remote Access > Configure Network
# Or use nmtui:
nmtui

# Or command line:
nmcli device wifi list
nmcli device wifi connect SSID password PASSWORD
```

### Ethernet
Usually auto-configured via DHCP. If not:
```bash
dhclient eth0
```

### Static IP
```bash
ip addr add 192.168.1.100/24 dev eth0
ip route add default via 192.168.1.1
echo "nameserver 8.8.8.8" > /etc/resolv.conf
```

## Troubleshooting

### Remote Desktop Not Working
- Check firewall: `ufw allow 3389` (RDP) or `ufw allow 5900` (VNC)
- Verify service running: `systemctl status xrdp`
- Check network connectivity: `ping 8.8.8.8`

### Can't Connect to Network
- Use NetworkManager TUI: `nmtui`
- Check interface status: `ip link`
- Restart NetworkManager: `systemctl restart NetworkManager`

### TeamViewer/AnyDesk Not Available
These require manual download due to licensing. The minimal build attempts to download them but may fail. Download manually:
- TeamViewer: https://www.teamviewer.com/
- AnyDesk: https://anydesk.com/

## Performance

Minimal ISO performance on typical hardware:

| Hardware | Boot Time | RAM Usage | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Modern PC | 30-60s | 500MB | Fast, smooth |
| Old PC (2010) | 1-2min | 400MB | Usable |
| Very Old (2005) | 2-3min | 350MB | Slow but works |

## Updates

To update the minimal ISO:
```bash
# Pull latest changes
git pull

# Rebuild
sudo ./build-minimal.sh

# Flash to USB
sudo dd if=dist/Nexus-USB-Minimal.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=4M
```
